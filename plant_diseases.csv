Apple,Powdery Mildew,"Fungal infection caused by Podosphaera leucotricha. Favored by warm, dry climates with high humidity.",Apply sulfur-based fungicides and maintain good orchard hygiene.,Ensure proper tree spacing for good air circulation.,"Forms white powdery patches on leaves, buds, and fruit, hindering growth."
Blueberry,Mummy Berry,Caused by the fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. Survives in soil and infects during early spring.,"Rake and remove fallen berries, apply mulch, and spray fungicides.",Choose resistant cultivars and monitor during bud break.,"Causes berries to shrivel and turn white, reducing yield."
Blueberry,Botrytis Blight,"Fungal disease caused by Botrytis cinerea, thriving in wet weather.","Improve drainage, remove infected debris, and use fungicides.",Reduce overhead watering and increase air circulation.,"Affects blossoms and fruit, leading to gray mold formation."
Blueberry,Phytophthora Root Rot,Caused by the soilborne pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. Develops in poorly drained soils.,"Improve drainage, avoid overwatering, and use resistant rootstocks.",Apply fungicides during susceptible periods.,"Roots turn black and decay, causing plant stunting and death."
Cherry,Brown Rot,Fungal disease caused by Monilinia spp. Infects blossoms and fruit during wet conditions.,"Prune trees to improve airflow, remove infected fruit, and apply fungicides.",Avoid overhead irrigation during bloom and fruit ripening.,"Forms brown spots on fruit, eventually rotting the entire fruit."
Cherry,Cherry Leaf Spot,Caused by the fungus Blumeriella jaapii. Common in wet spring weather.,"Apply fungicides early in the season, clean fallen leaves, and prune infected branches.",Rake fallen leaves to reduce reinfection risk.,"Small purple spots appear on leaves, causing defoliation and reduced fruit yield."
Cherry,Bacterial Canker,"Caused by Pseudomonas syringae, spreading through wounds and pruning cuts.","Use copper-based sprays, prune in dry weather, and apply wound sealants.",Avoid planting in poorly drained soils.,"Leads to branch dieback, cankers, and gumming on branches."
Corn,Northern Corn Leaf Blight,Fungal disease caused by Exserohilum turcicum. Develops in humid conditions.,"Plant resistant varieties, rotate crops, and apply fungicides.",Avoid planting corn in the same field consecutively.,"Causes long gray-green lesions on leaves, reducing photosynthesis and yield."
Corn,Corn Smut,Caused by the fungus Ustilago maydis. Infects through wounds or injuries.,"Avoid injuring plants, rotate crops, and remove infected plants.",Grow resistant hybrids and ensure balanced soil fertility.,"Forms large, black galls on ears, leaves, and stalks, reducing yield."
Corn,Maize Dwarf Mosaic Virus,Spread by aphids and infected seeds.,"Control aphids, plant virus-free seeds, and eliminate weed hosts.",Use resistant varieties and monitor for aphid activity.,"Causes stunted growth, mosaic-like discoloration on leaves, and reduced kernel formation."
Grape,Downy Mildew,Wet and humid conditions,Use resistant varieties,Improve vineyard airflow,"Downy mildew affects grape leaves and is caused by the Plasmopara viticola pathogen."
Orange,Citrus Canker,Bacterial infection,Remove infected parts,Disinfect tools,"Citrus canker causes lesions on leaves, stems, and fruit, spread by wind and rain."
Peach,Peach Leaf Curl,Fungal spores overwintering,Apply fungicides in spring,Remove infected leaves,"Peach leaf curl is caused by the Taphrina deformans fungus, deforming leaves."
Pepper,Anthracnose,Fungal infection,Remove infected fruits,Plant disease-resistant varieties,"Anthracnose affects peppers, causing sunken, dark lesions on fruit."
Potato,Blight,Fungal spores,Use resistant varieties,Regularly inspect plants,"Blight causes dark spots on potato leaves and stems, caused by Phytophthora infestans."
Raspberry,Root Rot,Excess soil moisture,Improve drainage,Use raised beds,"Root rot is caused by Phytophthora, affecting plant roots in overly wet soil."
Soybean,Asian Soybean Rust,High humidity and warm temperatures,Apply fungicides when needed,Monitor weather forecasts,"Asian soybean rust is caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi, leading to leaf yellowing."
Squash,Powdery Mildew,High humidity and poor airflow,Use sulfur or fungicides,Increase spacing between plants,"Powdery mildew is a fungal disease causing white powdery spots on leaves."
Strawberry,Gray Mold,Wet and humid conditions,Ensure good airflow,Remove infected berries,"Gray mold on strawberries is caused by Botrytis cinerea, affecting fruit quality."
Tomato,Blossom End Rot,Calcium deficiency,Maintain consistent watering,Avoid drought stress,"Blossom end rot causes dark, sunken spots on the blossom end of tomato fruits."
